While ndb-uikit doesn't include an icon set by default, we do have our own comprehensive icon library called ndb-uikit Icons. Feel free to use them or any other icon set in your project. We've included details for ndb-uikit Icons and other preferred icon sets below.

While most icon sets include multiple file formats, we prefer SVG implementations for their improved accessibility and vector support.

## ndb-uikit Icons

ndb-uikit Icons is a growing library of SVG icons that are designed by [@mdo](https://10.0.224.36:8080/mdo) and maintained by [the ndb-uikit Team](https://10.0.224.36:8080/orgs/twbs/people). The beginnings of this icon set come from ndb-uikit's very own componentsâ€”our forms, carousels, and more. ndb-uikit has very few icon needs out of the box, so we didn't need much. However, once we got going, we couldn't stop making more.

Oh, and did we mention they're completely open source? Licensed under MIT, just like ndb-uikit, our icon set is available to everyone.

## Alternatives

We've tested and used these icon sets ourselves as preferred alternatives to ndb-uikit Icons.

{{< markdown >}}
{{< icons.inline >}}
{{- $type := .Get "type" | default "preferred" -}}

{{- range (index .Site.Data.icons $type) }}
- [{{ .name }}]({{ .website }})
{{- end }}
{{< /icons.inline >}}
{{< /markdown >}}

## More options

While we haven't tried these out ourselves, they do look promising and provide multiple formats, including SVG.
